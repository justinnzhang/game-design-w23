* Hosted game here: https://game-design-w23.vercel.app
* Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/justinnzhang/game-design-w23

## How to run
> You can find the game running and deployed at https://game-design-w23.vercel.app.
1. Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
2. Explore the source code with [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Preferred), your own preferred text editor, or simply press `.` anywhere within the GitHub repository to explore the codebase within your browser!
3. Open the folder within any terminal application and type `npm install`
4. Navigate to your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
5. For an optimal experience, maximize your browser window (i.e. Full Screen)

## Game Notes
This is meant to be a vertical slice of the final game, showcasing in-depth the core mechanics and the point where the player first starts the game. There are a few key features to highlight:

### Main Interface
![Main interface of the game](https://github.com/justinnzhang/game-design-w23/blob/main/readme-images/interface.png)
Where the game happens, a view of the initial game experience - before the full story kicks in

### Screen Sizes
![Mobile View](https://github.com/justinnzhang/game-design-w23/blob/main/readme-images/screen.png)
If the window is too narrow (i.e. on a phone or small browser window), the game will not let you pass due to an un-optimal experience

### Testing Tool
![Testing tool](https://github.com/justinnzhang/game-design-w23/blob/main/readme-images/testing-tools.png)
Since this is a time-based game, I've provided a tool that speeds up earning by 10x speed. This will help you to experience more of this small vertical slice!
