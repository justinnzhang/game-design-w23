# Game Notes

This is a fully fledged, operational version of the final game. As you progress towards your goal to eventually surpass Starbucks, your focus quickly shifts towards automating as much of the store as you can...

To reach the final cutscene, you will need to complete all the checkpoints. Alternatively, **you can also just purchase all the costs**.

### Main Interface
